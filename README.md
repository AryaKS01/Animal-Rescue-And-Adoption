The issue occurred due to an initial misunderstanding regarding the expected features for implementation under the parent ticket. After discussing and confirming the correct requirements, I reverted the previously implemented changes that caused the bug. I then updated the implementation as per the clarified requirements in the parent ticket. The fix has been applied and the changes are now aligned with the expected behavior. Moving this ticket to QA Ready for verification.
