In a Jira ticket, the Impact Areas section should clearly state what parts of the system are affected by the code change, and what needs to be tested. Since you've added a new flag under the SVC Payment Method (ShowBalance on checkout), you should mention:

1. Where the change is made (e.g., admin configuration).


2. What functionality is affected (e.g., checkout process visibility).


3. What conditions QA should validate.



Here's a clean and professional way to write the Impact Areas section for your use case:


---

🛠️ Impact Areas

SVC Payment Method Configuration
A new flag ShowBalance on checkout has been added under System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > SVC Payment Method.

Checkout Page Behavior
The visibility of balance on the checkout page is now conditional based on the new flag.

QA Validation Required:

Validate both scenarios with the ShowBalance flag enabled and disabled.

Test with CorpAdmin user enabled and disabled to ensure correct visibility behavior.

Ensure the value is returned correctly in both Settings API and Payments API.

Let me know if you'd like to include references to specific file paths or APIs as well.
